### Zine Editor + Database

### What and why?

This zine editor + database allows users to make and share zines -- small self-published magazines often printed on A4 paper. Zines are great for easily and cheaply passing information or showcasing art. Using an online database to make and store zines can further simplify the zine-making and zine-distributing process.

### For whom?

These users are people inexperienced in Photoshop and Indesign or simply want a easy way to create zines. They prefer an easy-to-understand user interface, even if it lacks all the features of more complex Adobe apps.

### How?

The user will drag and drop photos, text, or shapes onto a blank canvas with the dimensions of an A4 sheet of paper. Once finished with their design, they can print it, save it to their personal account, or share it publicly to the greater community. The user can also view and print other users' public zines.

### Scope

Saving and viewing the database of zines seems like a task that can be accomplished; most of the work will be in implementing the zine editor, which requires some thought in UI/UX, how to implement the individual components, how to add photos from different sources etc.
